# ChatBot Application

## Overview

This is a simple ChatBot application written in TypeScript. It interacts with users via the command line interface (CLI) using the Node.js `readline` module. The ChatBot assists users with topics related to Agency services.

## Setup

To get started with the ChatBot application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Lodjuret2001/chatbot
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd chatbot
```

3. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

4. Install dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the ChatBot app, execute the following command:

```
npm start
```

Upon running the application, the ChatBot will introduce itself and prompt the user for input. Users can interact with the ChatBot by providing input through the command line.

The ChatBot will guide users through the conversation based on their inputs. Users can select topics and subtopics to receive relevant information and assistance.

## Testing

The ChatBot application includes unit tests to ensure its functionality remains intact as the codebase evolves. The tests are written using Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

```
npm test
```

Jest will execute all test suites in the project and provide feedback on the test results. Make sure all tests pass before making changes to the codebase.
